#How it works 
   This Arduino code sets up a communication interface using Serial communication at a baud rate of 9600. 
  
   It defines a relay using the `#define relay` directive. The program continuously checks for incoming data on the Serial interface.
  
   If data is available, it reads the data and prints it back via Serial. Depending on the received data, it either turns the relay on or off. 
  
   If the received data is '1', it sets pin 2 to LOW, turning the relay off. If the received data is '2', it sets pin 2 to HIGH, turning the relay on. 
   
   The program includes a delay of 100 milliseconds between iterations of the loop.
